[Data Track & Idea]

[Reflection]
Through this self-tracking process, I learned that my daily rhythm is less defined by physical location than by interpersonal connection. Although I live in New York, my conversations with a friend in Seoul quietly extend my day into theirs. By translating our message logs into data points—counts of texts, emojis, and media—I began to see the invisible pulse of our dialogue: moments of overlap, silence, and intensity across two time zones.
 While building the visualization, I realized that “data about myself” is never neutral. Each number is a fragment of emotion, filtered through context. The rotating clock and the dual hour hands (NYC and Seoul) revealed how my sense of time constantly shifts between two worlds. Watching the bubbles move thirteen hours ahead, changing color from neon yellow to deep blue, felt like watching my own attention migrate across the Pacific.
 What I gained from the process was distance and clarity. Data allowed me to step outside my routine and see my communication pattern as a living system. Yet something was also lost—its warmth and spontaneity. The visualization cannot capture the meaning of each message, only its rhythm. Still, by reducing my days into orbiting circles, I discovered that self-tracking can be both analytical and poetic: a way of measuring not productivity, but presence.
